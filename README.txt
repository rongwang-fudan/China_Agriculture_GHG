A notification will be released when there is update of the data.

Please note that:
(1) run 'A1_Climate_impact_yield' file to generate the impact of climate change on food production.  
(2) run 'A2_Prepare_areayield_data' file to generate the arable land area, as well as the grain yield under different technological managements at the county level in China. 
(3) run 'A3_Large_scale_farm_optimize' file to optimize the spatial distribution of arable land in China after large-scale farming. 
(4) run 'A4_Emis_cost_current_farm' file to generate the agricultural emissions, costs, and production scenarios for 2836 counties in China under the farmland before large-scale farmming.
(5) run 'A5_Emis_cost_large_scale_farm' file to generate the agricultural emissions, costs, and production scenarios for 2836 counties in China under the farmland after large-scale farmming. 
(6) run 'A6_Emis_cost_combine' file to merge the agricultural emissions, costs, and production data from all scenarios. 
(7) run 'A7_Emis_cost_different_sce' file to generate data such as emissions, costs, and production for the scenario in the main text (CUR,Case A,Case B,Case C,Case D,Case E,and Case F).
